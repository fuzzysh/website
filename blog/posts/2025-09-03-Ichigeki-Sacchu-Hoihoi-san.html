                        <img src="../images/hoihoi/cover.jpg" alt="the cover art of Ichigeki Sacchu Hoihoi-san for the PS2">

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">It's the year 20XX. Bugs have become immune to all pesticides and are multiplying at an incredible rate. This has caused quite a problem for the human race. However!! The medical company Mars Pharmaceuticals took the situation seriously and created a compact exterminator robot to replace the old forms of pesticide that had been rendered useless. 11.5 cm high maid robot Interceptor Doll "Ichigeki Sacchu Hoihoi-san (Price 29,800¥ plus tax)" now on sale!!</p>

                        <p>Ichigeki Sacchu!! Hoihoi-san is a bug exterminating action game for the PlayStation 2. Take control of "Hoihoi-san", the titular battle doll and go to combat with cockroaches, ants, bees, termites, competing products(!?), and more. </p>
                        
                        <img src="../images/hoihoi/waitresspanzer.png" alt="Hoihoi-san in a red waitress uniform firing her panzer faust bazooka">

                        <p>Hoihoi-san started as a one-page manga by Kunihiko Tanaka (character designer for the Xenogears, Xenosaga, and Xenoblade Chronicles series) serialized in Dengeki Daioh.</p>

                        <p>Hoihoi-san is more than just a pesticide, she's also a member of your family. Mars Pharmaceuticals recognizes this and offers many customization options. From a waitress dress to a sukumizu, Hoihoi-san can be customized to your liking. If you fill out your points card you might get a chance to receive the coveted nekomimi!</p>

                        <img src="../images/hoihoi/nekomimisukumizurevolver.png" alt="Hoihoi-san in a sukumizu holding up two revolvers">                                

                        <p>The game features 3 main mission types, assault missions where you seek and destroy all bugs in a level, defense missions where you must protect bug-attracting foodstuffs like cake (put your damn food away, Aburatsubo-kun!), and intense boss battles that will force you to strategize and come up with the optimal load-out to overcome a great challenge. Try to aim for an A-Rank!</p>

                        <p>I loved playing Ichigeki Sacchu!! Hoihoi-san! It's combination of moe and creepy was awesome, and customizing Hoihoi-san with my preferred outfits and weapons made me feel like a real Hoihoi-san otaku customizing my own exterminator robot. </p>

                        <img src="../images/hoihoi/flailgun2.png" alt="Hoihoi-san dashing towards the camera in her iconic maid dress wielding a flail and a light machine gun">

                        <p>The game controls are simple, by utilizing only 4 buttons Hoihoi-san's response to your commands feel natural. It takes no time at all to get comfortable with the gameplay. While being easy to control, the game still offers quite a challenge and it isn't rare to find yourself retrying a stage to try to receive a higher rank. This gives Ichigeki Sacchu!! Hoihoi-san a ton of replayabilty. I finished the games missions in just 3 sittings, so the added fun of replaying levels for rank is a nice bonus.</p>

                        <p>Watch out for level 2-6. Rumour has it that getting an A-Rank will earn you a Hoihoi-san gothic lolita dress...</p>
