                                                                <p>By using a familiar romcom forumula, Okitsura educates the viewer on Okinawan history and culture. I really enjoyed learning about Okinawan culture alongside Teruaki, the protagonist. Millipensee uses a lot of animation techniques that remind me of cel animation. It's a very intentional look that even give off an "Okinawa"-ish impression. It has a light and breezy flow. It's clear they see animation as an art form! The series' concept wouldn't work if the characters weren't good. I really enjoyed getting to spend time with Kyan-san, Higa-san, and Agena-san. The character moe was very strong. Even the old grandmas were moe! </p>

It's a colourful and lively slice of life about recovering from a slump and finding new motivation! It's a tour of the parts of Yamanashi prefecture that don't involve camping. Growth, adventure, and love... I really loved the time I spent with the characters in this show, I even rewatched each episode at least once! With a colourful style and excellent voice acting the show really came to life and stole my heart! Kiriyama An... I will die for you... To ensure you get to smile for another day... The story is simple, but really poignant!</p>

It doesn't reach the levels of Hidamari Sketch or Madoka, but NinKoro is one of my favourite SHAFT works! The characters are full of personality, the style's a little offbeat, the directing is high quality. It's a SHAFT anime! What else can I say? SHAFT is back!?</p>

They chat and joke around, share their troubles with each other and cause trouble for each other. The simple concept let's the series focus on non-stop comedy. It's one of the funniest anime I've ever watched. It only ran for 6 episodes but they're jam-packed and guaranteed to make you smile.</p>

Everything in nature is connected by a process of creation that's still ongoing. Rivers and mountains are created over the course of millions of years. Ruri no Houseki is a story about discovering this process that's hidden in plain sight. Look down at your feet and you might discover evidence of this never ending cycle. By utilizing moe, Ruri no Houseki turns a monotonous lecture into an exciting and poignant story. Watching over Ruri's growth as her world widens up with the help of Nagi was very inspiring. We all have the same potential for curiosity and growth as Ruri.</p>

I was surprised while watching the first episode. It has a manic pace, and felt like it was really leaning into the satire. "Is this done by the Di Gi Charat director or something?". Oh, it is! The show caught me off guard a second time, I'm attached to the main character! She develops an interesting complex where she refuses to accept that people trust her - surely they're constantly waiting for her to reveal her evil nature at which point she'd be killed. This pushes her to make a bunch of bad decisions that put her in grave danger. She's an interesting character!</p>

The sky was higher than we'd ever imagined, the breeze felt so good... and the sun was just so dazzling... and the air was full of all kinds of scents. After leaving the shelter... we had fun times, first-ever experiences, things that didn't work out. A lot of stuff happened. What I want to see now isn't the outside world that I've always dreamed of, but this world right now, I think."

It feels like an anime from the heisei era - it's character designs and world don't follow modern trends. It feels otaku-like, almost like it could have been a VN. These aesthetics aren't an accident. The show is about a conflict between Heisei and Reiwa ideals! It's really refreshing to watch an anime that handles topics like love and gender in such a forwarding thinking way. I really fell in love with the characters. I was crying by the end, it was really touching!</p>
