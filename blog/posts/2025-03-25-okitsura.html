                                Okitsura is a really charming and cute anime! It's a romcom, but it has a very heavy focus on Okinawan culture. It uses the romcom format to showcase Okinawa. Teru, the protagonist, is from the mainland and is new to Okinawa. There are many obvious and subtle differences between the mainland and Okinawa, Teru serves as an excellent stand-in for any uninformed viewer. The heroines, Kana (Fairouz Ai) and Hina (Kitou Akari), educate Teru on Okinawan culture in a natural, conversational way. By having the information be presented by cute girls in a easy-going manner the show remains light and easy to digest despite the occasionally heavy amount of information being presented.

                                In episode 9 we learn about the Iriomote Cat, which lives on Iriomote Island in Okinawa. The information is presented cutely, featuring the girls in Iriomote kigurumi. It goes over the history of the species and provides a broad scope of information without getting boring. The information is used to convince Kana's little sister to eat her tomatoes, which gives a wholesome and folkish vibe. Finally, a warning is given about the pricarity of the Iriomote Cats situation. It's a very effective scene and I don't think I've ever seen something like it before.

                                The show is really moe! The girls share the spotlight with Okinawa and their charms are a big part of the shows appeal.

                                                The main heroine is Kana. Kana's a quiet girl, but she's not timid or shy. She has a kind heart and big boobs. She's easily embarrassed, especially when she's around Teru. She's childhood friends with Hina, and their close relationship and love for eachother is really heartwarming.</dd>

                                                Hina is an outgoing and bubbly girl who often speaks in Uchinaaguchi, the traditional Okinawan language. Teru, being from the mainland, doesn't understand much of her speech and relies on Kana to interperet. Hina is childhood friends with Kana, and would often defend her from bullies when growing up. The two girls have a tight bond that won't ever be broken.</dd>

                                                Yae is classmates with Kana and Hina. She's noticed Kana's feelings for Teru and teas- er, supports her with all her might! She's a cool and socialable girl with short hair and a deep voice. She seems to be the kind of girl who gets along with everyone.</dd>

                                The animation is really charming. It uses a combination of simple animation tricks, high quality animation and exagerated animation. The different styles are used wisely in different scenes and gives the series a really cohesive and unique style. A lot of the techniques used remind me of the resourcefulness seen in 80s anime, but I don't think I've ever seen a show that looked quite like this.

                                OkiTsura is definitely a special anime. I was skeptical on whether or not I'd enjoy it but it really blew me away. I strongly recommend it!!!
