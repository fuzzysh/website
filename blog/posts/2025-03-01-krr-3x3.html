                                <p>Hi, I'd like to write about some of my favouite manga published in Kirara! I'll present these as a 3x3 image and then get into details about each manga and why it means so much to me.</p>
                                <div class="blog-image-container">
                                        <img class="sheet blog-image" src="../images/Kirara3x3.PNG" alt="">

                                <h4>A-Channel</h4>
                                <p>A-Channel is the ultimate high-school moe series. bb-sensei's cast is diverse and defined, with each major character falling into a clear archetype, and the expression of these archetypes is perfected. The series features cute girls wasting their precious high school years together, making good memories and forging strong bonds.</p>
                                <p>A-Channel leans heavily into perverted jokes, and emphasises sexier charm-points like Tooru's zettai ryoiki and Yuko's curves. In fact, bb-sensei included so many jokes about boobs that his editor banned him from making any more.</p>
                                <h4>Urara Meirochou</h4>
                                <p>Urara Meirochou focuses on two main points: visual moe, meaning a physical appearence that creates moe, and character moe, meaning personality traits that endear a character to you. It pulls these off excellently, immedietely investing you into the journey of the characters and compelling you to root for them during their difficult journey.</p>
                                <h4>Hidamari Sketch</h4>
                                <p>What can I even say about Hidamari Sketch? Featuring a cast of eccentric characters, Hidamari Sketch immedietely endears them to you, and then gradually creates situations where you find yourself rooting for them.</p>
                                <h4>Gochiusa</h4>
